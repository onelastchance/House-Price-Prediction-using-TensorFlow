# House-Price-prediction-using-Tensorflow
In this project, I am going to work on evaluating price of houses given the following features:  
1.Year of sale of the house 
2.The age of the house at the time of sale 
3.Distance from city center 
4.Number of stores in the locality 
5.The latitude 
6.The longitude

All the description of code are mentioned in the code itself .So it is easy to understand .
